## Project Overview

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial recognition. It includes data preprocessing with scikit-learn, image handling with OpenCV, and a Flask web service for model deployment.

## Environment Setup

1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv facial_recognition_env
    source facial_recognition_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `facial_recognition_env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow opencv-python-headless flask
    ```
